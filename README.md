This project is aimed at predicting future sales for a retail company. 

### Author:

### Business problem:
TO help the company determine the main business drivers, and their contribution to the business, and the performance of the different business branches.

### Data:
The dataset used in this project is provided by the company and contains information on historical sales along with other relevant features.
1. Consists of the various contributing branches of the comapny
2. The various products offered by the company
3. Sales of the differenmt products offered over time 

### Methods
Data Cleaning
Exploratory Analysis
Two Sales Prediction Models 

### Results

**Frequency Distribution of Item_Types**

It can be observed that Fruits and Vegetables are most frequently requested and are the main driving items for the overall sales, followed by Snack Foods and in a very close range and then Household. 
These items should be stocked more often.
Seafood and Breakfast have very little contribution to the overall sales.

**Distribution of Stores**

It can be observed that the Supermarkets of Type1 have contributed well to the overall sales ie 69.5% and Grocery Stores have contributed the least to the overall sales.

## The Random Forest Model
A model has been attached that predicts the future sales of the different items in all the stores basing on the historical data.
The model has been  evaluated on the RMSE and R^2 Metrics.
Basing on the R^2 Metrics.
The model can now correlate and account for 60.4% of the data in the y_test and the model is relatively balanced

### Recommendation.
While there are two models attached, I highly recommend the use of the Random Forest Model on the dataset as it makes prediuctions with a more accurate prediction 

### Limitations & Next Steps
The Model is  not 100% accurate however it can be tuned further using the vatrious model parameters to give more accurate predictions.
